Build AI agents that autonomously read files, run commands, search the web, edit code, and more. The Agent SDK gives you the same tools, agent loop, and context management that power Claude Code, programmable in Python and TypeScript.

The Agent SDK includes built-in tools for reading files, running commands, and editing code, so your agent can start working immediately without you implementing tool execution. Dive into the quickstart or explore real agents built with the SDK:

**Ready to build?** Follow the [Quickstart](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/quickstart) to create an agent that finds and fixes bugs in minutes.

## Capabilities

Everything that makes Claude Code powerful is available in the SDK:

*   Built-in tools

*   Hooks

*   Subagents

*   MCP

*   Permissions

*   Sessions

Your agent can read files, run commands, and search codebases out of the box. Key tools include:

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Read** | Read any file in the working directory |
| **Write** | Create new files |
| **Edit** | Make precise edits to existing files |
| **Bash** | Run terminal commands, scripts, git operations |
| **Monitor** | Watch a background script and react to each output line as an event |
| **Glob** | Find files by pattern (`**/*.ts`, `src/**/*.py`) |
| **Grep** | Search file contents with regex |
| **WebSearch** | Search the web for current information |
| **WebFetch** | Fetch and parse web page content |
| **[AskUserQuestion](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/user-input#handle-clarifying-questions)** | Ask the user clarifying questions with multiple choice options |

This example creates an agent that searches your codebase for TODO comments:

Run custom code at key points in the agent lifecycle. SDK hooks use callback functions to validate, log, block, or transform agent behavior.**Available hooks:**`PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `Stop`, `SessionStart`, `SessionEnd`, `UserPromptSubmit`, and more.This example logs all file changes to an audit file:

Spawn specialized agents to handle focused subtasks. Your main agent delegates work, and subagents report back with results.Define custom agents with specialized instructions. Include `Agent` in `allowedTools` since subagents are invoked via the Agent tool:

Messages from within a subagent’s context include a `parent_tool_use_id` field, letting you track which messages belong to which subagent execution.[Learn more about subagents →](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/subagents)

Control exactly which tools your agent can use. Allow safe operations, block dangerous ones, or require approval for sensitive actions.

This example creates a read-only agent that can analyze but not modify code. `allowed_tools` pre-approves `Read`, `Glob`, and `Grep`.

Maintain context across multiple exchanges. Claude remembers files read, analysis done, and conversation history. Resume sessions later, or fork them to explore different approaches.This example captures the session ID from the first query, then resumes to continue with full context:

### Claude Code features

The SDK also supports Claude Code’s filesystem-based configuration. With default options the SDK loads these from `.claude/` in your working directory and `~/.claude/`. To restrict which sources load, set `setting_sources` (Python) or `settingSources` (TypeScript) in your options.

| Feature | Description | Location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/skills) | Specialized capabilities defined in Markdown | `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` |
| [Slash commands](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/slash-commands) | Custom commands for common tasks | `.claude/commands/*.md` |
| [Memory](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/modifying-system-prompts) | Project context and instructions | `CLAUDE.md` or `.claude/CLAUDE.md` |
| [Plugins](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/plugins) | Extend with custom commands, agents, and MCP servers | Programmatic via `plugins` option |

## Compare the Agent SDK to other Claude tools

The Claude Platform offers multiple ways to build with Claude. Here’s how the Agent SDK fits in:

*   Agent SDK vs Client SDK

*   Agent SDK vs Claude Code CLI

*   Agent SDK vs Managed Agents

The [Anthropic Client SDK](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/client-sdks) gives you direct API access: you send prompts and implement tool execution yourself. The **Agent SDK** gives you Claude with built-in tool execution.With the Client SDK, you implement a tool loop. With the Agent SDK, Claude handles it:

Same capabilities, different interface:

| Use case | Best choice |
| --- | --- |
| Interactive development | CLI |
| CI/CD pipelines | SDK |
| Custom applications | SDK |
| One-off tasks | CLI |
| Production automation | SDK |

Many teams use both: CLI for daily development, SDK for production. Workflows translate directly between them.

[Managed Agents](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/managed-agents/overview) is a hosted REST API: Anthropic runs the agent and the sandbox, and your application sends events and streams back results. The **Agent SDK** is a library that runs the agent loop inside your own process.

|  | Agent SDK | Managed Agents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Runs in** | Your process, your infrastructure | Anthropic-managed infrastructure |
| **Interface** | Python or TypeScript library | REST API |
| **Agent works on** | Files on your infrastructure | A managed sandbox per session |
| **Session state** | JSONL on your filesystem | Anthropic-hosted event log |
| **Custom tools** | In-process Python or TypeScript functions | Claude triggers the tool; you execute and return results |
| **Best for** | Local prototyping, agents that work directly on your filesystem and services | Production agents without operating sandbox or session infrastructure, long-running and asynchronous sessions |

A common path is to prototype with the Agent SDK locally, then move to Managed Agents for production.

## Branding guidelines

For partners integrating the Claude Agent SDK, use of Claude branding is optional. When referencing Claude in your product:**Allowed:**

*   “Claude Agent” (preferred for dropdown menus)
*   “Claude” (when within a menu already labeled “Agents”)
*   ” Powered by Claude” (if you have an existing agent name)

**Not permitted:**

*   “Claude Code” or “Claude Code Agent”
*   Claude Code-branded ASCII art or visual elements that mimic Claude Code

Your product should maintain its own branding and not appear to be Claude Code or any Anthropic product. For questions about branding compliance, contact the Anthropic [sales team](https://www.anthropic.com/contact-sales).

## License and terms

Use of the Claude Agent SDK is governed by [Anthropic’s Commercial Terms of Service](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/commercial-terms), including when you use it to power products and services that you make available to your own customers and end users, except to the extent a specific component or dependency is covered by a different license as indicated in that component’s LICENSE file.
