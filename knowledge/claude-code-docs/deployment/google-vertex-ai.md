## Prerequisites

Before configuring Claude Code with Vertex AI, ensure you have:

*   A Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account with billing enabled
*   A GCP project with Vertex AI API enabled
*   Access to desired Claude models (for example, Claude Sonnet 4.6)
*   Google Cloud SDK (`gcloud`) installed and configured
*   Quota allocated in desired GCP region

To sign in with your own Vertex AI credentials, follow [Sign in with Vertex AI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/google-vertex-ai#sign-in-with-vertex-ai) below. To deploy Claude Code across a team, use the [manual setup](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/google-vertex-ai#set-up-manually) steps and [pin your model versions](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/google-vertex-ai#5-pin-model-versions) before rolling out.

## Sign in with Vertex AI

If you have Google Cloud credentials and want to start using Claude Code through Vertex AI, the login wizard walks you through it. You complete the GCP-side prerequisites once per project; the wizard handles the Claude Code side.

After you’ve signed in, run `/setup-vertex` any time to reopen the wizard and change your credentials, project, region, or model pins.

## Region configuration

Claude Code supports Vertex AI [global](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/global-endpoint-for-claude-models-generally-available-on-vertex-ai), multi-region, and regional endpoints. Set `CLOUD_ML_REGION` to `global`, a multi-region location such as `eu` or `us`, or a specific region such as `us-east5`. Claude Code selects the correct Vertex AI hostname for each form, including the `aiplatform.eu.rep.googleapis.com` and `aiplatform.us.rep.googleapis.com` hosts for multi-region locations.

## Set up manually

To configure Vertex AI through environment variables instead of the wizard, for example in CI or a scripted enterprise rollout, follow the steps below.

### 1. Enable Vertex AI API

Enable the Vertex AI API in your GCP project:

```
# Set your project ID
gcloud config set project YOUR-PROJECT-ID

# Enable Vertex AI API
gcloud services enable aiplatform.googleapis.com
```

### 2. Request model access

Request access to Claude models in Vertex AI:

1.   Navigate to the [Vertex AI Model Garden](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/model-garden)
2.   Search for “Claude” models
3.   Request access to desired Claude models (for example, Claude Sonnet 4.6)
4.   Wait for approval (may take 24-48 hours)

### 3. Configure GCP credentials

Claude Code uses standard Google Cloud authentication.For more information, see [Google Cloud authentication documentation](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication).Claude Code v2.1.121 or later supports [X.509 certificate-based Workload Identity Federation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation-with-x509-certificates) through the same Application Default Credentials chain. Set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to the path of your credential configuration file.

### 4. Configure Claude Code

Set the following environment variables:

```
# Enable Vertex AI integration
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1
export CLOUD_ML_REGION=global
export ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=YOUR-PROJECT-ID

# Optional: Override the Vertex endpoint URL for custom endpoints or gateways
# export ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_BASE_URL=https://aiplatform.googleapis.com

# Optional: Disable prompt caching if needed
export DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING=1

# Optional: Request 1-hour prompt cache TTL instead of the 5-minute default
export ENABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_1H=1

# When CLOUD_ML_REGION=global, override region for models that don't support global endpoints
export VERTEX_REGION_CLAUDE_HAIKU_4_5=us-east5
export VERTEX_REGION_CLAUDE_4_6_SONNET=europe-west1
```

Most model versions have a corresponding `VERTEX_REGION_CLAUDE_*` variable. See the [Environment variables reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/env-vars) for the full list. Check [Vertex Model Garden](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/model-garden) to determine which models support global endpoints versus regional only.[Prompt caching](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching) is enabled automatically. To disable it, set `DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING=1`. To request a 1-hour cache TTL instead of the 5-minute default, set `ENABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_1H=1`; cache writes with a 1-hour TTL are billed at a higher rate. For heightened rate limits, contact Google Cloud support. When using Vertex AI, the `/login` and `/logout` commands are disabled since authentication is handled through Google Cloud credentials.[MCP tool search](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp#scale-with-mcp-tool-search) is disabled by default on Vertex AI because the endpoint does not accept the required beta header. All MCP tool definitions load upfront instead. To opt in, set `ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH=true`.

### 5. Pin model versions

Set these environment variables to specific Vertex AI model IDs.Without `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL`, the `opus` alias on Vertex resolves to Opus 4.6. Set it to the Opus 4.7 ID to use the latest model:

```
export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL='claude-opus-4-7'
export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL='claude-sonnet-4-6'
export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL='claude-haiku-4-5@20251001'
```

For current and legacy model IDs, see [Models overview](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview). See [Model configuration](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/model-config#pin-models-for-third-party-deployments) for the full list of environment variables.Claude Code uses these default models when no pinning variables are set:

| Model type | Default value |
| --- | --- |
| Primary model | `claude-sonnet-4-5@20250929` |
| Small/fast model | `claude-haiku-4-5@20251001` |

To customize models further:

```
export ANTHROPIC_MODEL='claude-opus-4-7'
export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL='claude-haiku-4-5@20251001'
```

## Startup model checks

When Claude Code starts with Vertex AI configured, it verifies that the models it intends to use are accessible in your project. This check requires Claude Code v2.1.98 or later.If you have pinned a model version that is older than the current Claude Code default, and your project can invoke the newer version, Claude Code prompts you to update the pin. Accepting writes the new model ID to your [user settings file](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings) and restarts Claude Code. Declining is remembered until the next default version change.If you have not pinned a model and the current default is unavailable in your project, Claude Code falls back to the previous version for the current session and shows a notice. The fallback is not persisted. Enable the newer model in [Model Garden](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/model-garden) or [pin a version](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/google-vertex-ai#5-pin-model-versions) to make the choice permanent.

## IAM configuration

Assign the required IAM permissions:The `roles/aiplatform.user` role includes the required permissions:

*   `aiplatform.endpoints.predict` - Required for model invocation and token counting

For more restrictive permissions, create a custom role with only the permissions above.For details, see [Vertex IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/general/access-control).

## 1M token context window

Claude Opus 4.7, Opus 4.6, and Sonnet 4.6 support the [1M token context window](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows#1m-token-context-window) on Vertex AI. Claude Code automatically enables the extended context window when you select a 1M model variant.The [setup wizard](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/google-vertex-ai#sign-in-with-vertex-ai) offers a 1M context option when it pins models. To enable it for a manually pinned model instead, append `[1m]` to the model ID. See [Pin models for third-party deployments](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/model-config#pin-models-for-third-party-deployments) for details.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter quota issues:

*   Check current quotas or request quota increase through [Cloud Console](https://cloud.google.com/docs/quotas/view-manage)

If you encounter “model not found” 404 errors:

*   Confirm model is Enabled in [Model Garden](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/model-garden)
*   Verify the model is available in the location you specified. Some models are offered only on `global` or multi-region locations such as `eu` and `us`, not in specific regions
*   If using `CLOUD_ML_REGION=global`, check that your models support global endpoints in [Model Garden](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/model-garden) under “Supported features”. For models that don’t support global endpoints, either:
    *   Specify a supported model via `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` or `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL`, or
    *   Set a region or multi-region location using `VERTEX_REGION_<MODEL_NAME>` environment variables

If you encounter 429 errors:

*   For regional endpoints, ensure the primary model and small/fast model are supported in your selected region
*   Consider switching to `CLOUD_ML_REGION=global` for better availability
