This quickstart guide will have you using AI-powered coding assistance in a few minutes. By the end, you’ll understand how to use Claude Code for common development tasks.

## Before you begin

Make sure you have:

*   A terminal or command prompt open
    *   If you’ve never used the terminal before, check out the [terminal guide](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/terminal-guide)

*   A code project to work with
*   A [Claude subscription](https://claude.com/pricing?utm_source=claude_code&utm_medium=docs&utm_content=quickstart_prereq) (Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise), [Claude Console](https://console.anthropic.com/) account, or access through a [supported cloud provider](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/third-party-integrations)

## Step 1: Install Claude Code

To install Claude Code, use one of the following methods:

*   Native Install (Recommended)

*   Homebrew

*   WinGet

**macOS, Linux, WSL:**

```
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows PowerShell:**

```
irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

**Windows CMD:**

```
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.cmd -o install.cmd && install.cmd && del install.cmd
```

If you see `The token '&&' is not a valid statement separator`, you’re in PowerShell, not CMD. If you see `'irm' is not recognized as an internal or external command`, you’re in CMD, not PowerShell. Your prompt shows `PS C:\` when you’re in PowerShell and `C:\` without the `PS` when you’re in CMD.[Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win) is recommended on native Windows so Claude Code can use the Bash tool. If Git for Windows is not installed, Claude Code uses PowerShell as the shell tool instead. WSL setups do not need Git for Windows.

```
brew install --cask claude-code
```

Homebrew offers two casks. `claude-code` tracks the stable release channel, which is typically about a week behind and skips releases with major regressions. `claude-code@latest` tracks the latest channel and receives new versions as soon as they ship.

```
winget install Anthropic.ClaudeCode
```

You can also install with [apt, dnf, or apk](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup#install-with-linux-package-managers) on Debian, Fedora, RHEL, and Alpine.

## Step 2: Log in to your account

Claude Code requires an account to use. When you start an interactive session with the `claude` command, you’ll need to log in:

```
claude
# You'll be prompted to log in on first use
```

```
/login
# Follow the prompts to log in with your account
```

You can log in using any of these account types:

*   [Claude Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise](https://claude.com/pricing?utm_source=claude_code&utm_medium=docs&utm_content=quickstart_login) (recommended)
*   [Claude Console](https://console.anthropic.com/) (API access with pre-paid credits). On first login, a “Claude Code” workspace is automatically created in the Console for centralized cost tracking.
*   [Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, or Microsoft Foundry](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/third-party-integrations) (enterprise cloud providers)

Once logged in, your credentials are stored and you won’t need to log in again. To switch accounts later, use the `/login` command.

## Step 3: Start your first session

Open your terminal in any project directory and start Claude Code:

```
cd /path/to/your/project
claude
```

You’ll see the Claude Code welcome screen with your session information, recent conversations, and latest updates. Type `/help` for available commands or `/resume` to continue a previous conversation.

## Step 4: Ask your first question

Let’s start with understanding your codebase. Try one of these commands:

```
what does this project do?
```

Claude will analyze your files and provide a summary. You can also ask more specific questions:

```
what technologies does this project use?
```

```
where is the main entry point?
```

```
explain the folder structure
```

You can also ask Claude about its own capabilities:

```
what can Claude Code do?
```

```
how do I create custom skills in Claude Code?
```

```
can Claude Code work with Docker?
```

## Step 5: Make your first code change

Now let’s make Claude Code do some actual coding. Try a simple task:

```
add a hello world function to the main file
```

Claude Code will:

1.   Find the appropriate file
2.   Show you the proposed changes
3.   Ask for your approval
4.   Make the edit

## Step 6: Use Git with Claude Code

Claude Code makes Git operations conversational:

```
what files have I changed?
```

```
commit my changes with a descriptive message
```

You can also prompt for more complex Git operations:

```
create a new branch called feature/quickstart
```

```
show me the last 5 commits
```

```
help me resolve merge conflicts
```

## Step 7: Fix a bug or add a feature

Claude is proficient at debugging and feature implementation.Describe what you want in natural language:

```
add input validation to the user registration form
```

Or fix existing issues:

```
there's a bug where users can submit empty forms - fix it
```

Claude Code will:

*   Locate the relevant code
*   Understand the context
*   Implement a solution
*   Run tests if available

## Step 8: Test out other common workflows

There are a number of ways to work with Claude:**Refactor code**

```
refactor the authentication module to use async/await instead of callbacks
```

**Write tests**

```
write unit tests for the calculator functions
```

**Update documentation**

```
update the README with installation instructions
```

**Code review**

```
review my changes and suggest improvements
```
